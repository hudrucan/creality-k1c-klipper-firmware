## Load Cell Community Testing Branch 

This is a marker branch for the klipper community to use when testing Load Cell
Probing. This branch contains all the proposed changes that will eventually be
submitted as Pull Requests (PR's) to klipper mainline.

When klipper merges one of these changes this branch will be rebased on top of
that change. This branch will also contain the live updates as the PR's are
worked on and will be updated frequently as the work progresses.

Changes that break printer config are expected to happen in this branch. It is
best to keep track of the ongoing PR's as that is where any config updates will
be discussed.
